Note:  Everything in this repository  is a Work In Progress (WIP), there are no 
warranties or guarantees of any kind.   Use at your own risk!  However I hope some 
of you have fun with it!

This folder contains the source code for Kurt’s (Member KurtEck up on trossenrobotics)
PhantomX Reactor Arm. The Arm can be purchased at Trossen Robotics: 
http://www.trossenrobotics.com/p/phantomx-ax-12-reactor-robot-arm.aspx

Currently the code is only setup to run like a mechanical BackHoe, where you use the
joysticks to move each of the joints.  I need to confirm that I am going in the right 
direction for each of these joints.  Will check that soon on my real Backhoe ;)

I will soon make this a mode and also add a mode where you can control the Arm using 
Inverse Kinematics (IK) code.   Some of the support code is started, but has not yet been 
finished nor is there any place where this code is called out yet.

Again this is a WIP!

Kurt
